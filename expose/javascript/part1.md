1. values added: 20, add is true, so it enters the if (add) block. result = num1 + num2 = 10 + 10 = 20.

2. final result: 20, var result is function-scoped (because of var), not block-scoped. So even though result was declared inside the if block, it still exists after the block inside the function.

3. var is function-scoped, not block-scoped. This can lead to unexpected behavior where a variable declared inside an if, for, or while is still accessible outside that block â€” which may cause bugs.

4. values added: 20, add is true, so it enters the if (add) block. result = num1 + num2 = 10 + 10 = 20.

5. The code will return an error. This is beacuse result was declared using let inside the if block, which makes it block-scoped, so result is not accesible outside the if block resulting in an error.

6. No output, the code would crash at line 7, as we're trying to reassign result which was declared as a constant.
